.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
.B yppush
copies updated NIS databases (or maps) from the master NIS server to
the slave servers within a NIS domain. It is normally run only on
the NIS master by
.I @YPMAPDIR@/Makefile
after the master databases are changed.
.I @YPMAPDIR@/Makefile
does not invoke
.B yppush
by default, the
.B NOPUSH=true
line must be commented out.
.br
.B yppush
first constructs a list of NIS slave servers by reading the NIS map
.B ypservers
within the
.I domain.
A destination host (or a list of hosts with multiple \-h commands)
can also be specified on the command line.
A "transfer map" request is sent to the NIS serger at each slave, along
with the information needed by the transfer agent ypxfr(8) to callback
to yppush, which may be printed the result to stderr. Messages are
also printed when a transfer is not possible; for instance when the request
message is undeliverable.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "\-d " domain
Specify a particular domain. The NIS domain of the local host system is
used by default. If the local host's domain name is not set, the domain
name must be specified with this flag.
.TP
.BI "\-t " timeout
The timeout flag is used to specify a timeout value in seconds. This timeout
controls how long
.B yppush
will wait for a response from a slave server before sending a
map transfer request to the next slave server in the list.
By default,
.B yppush
will wait 90 seconds. For big maps, this is not long enough.
.TP
.BI "\-p " "# parallel jobs"
.B yppush
normally performs transfers serially, meaning that it will
send a map transfer request to one slave server and then wait for
it to respond before sending the next map transfer request to the
next slave server. In environments with many slaves, it is more
efficient to initiate several map transfers at once so that the
transfers can take place in parallel.
.TP
.BI "\-h " host
The host flag can be used to transfer a map to a user-specified machine or
group of machines instead of the list of servers contained in
the
.B ypservers
map. A list of hosts can be specified by using multiple
instances of the
.B "\-h"
flag.
.B \-v
Verbose mode: causes
.B yppush
to print debugging messages as it runs. Note specifying this flag twice
makes
.B yppush
even more verbose.

.LP
.SH BUGS
The mechanism for transferring NIS maps in NIS v1 is different
that that in NIS version 2. This version of
.Nm yppush
has support for transferring maps to NIS v2 systems only.
