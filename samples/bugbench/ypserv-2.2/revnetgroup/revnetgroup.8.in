.TH REVNETGROUP 8 "August 2001" "YP Server" "Reference Manual"
.SH NAME
revnetgroup \- generate reverse netgroup data
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB@YPBINDIR@/revnetgroup\fR [\fB-u\fR|\fB-h\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Revnetgroup
processes the standard input in
.BR netgroup (5)
format into what is called
.I reverse netgroup
form. That is, where the original file shows netgroup memberships in
terms of which members reside in a particular
group, the reverse netgroup format specifies what groups are associated
with a particular member. This information is used to generate the
.B netgroup.byuser
and
.B netgroup.byhosts
NIS maps. These reverse netgroup maps are used to help speed up
netgroup lookups, particularly for the
.B innetgr
library function.
.PP
The
.B revnetgroup
command prints its results on the standard output. It is usually called
only by
.B /var/yp/Makefile
when rebuilding the NIS netgroup maps.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.B revnetgroup
command supports the following options:
.TP
.B \-u
Generate
.B netgroup.byuser
output; only username information in the
original netgroup file is processed.
.TP
.B \-h
Generate
.B netgroup.byhost
output; only hostname information in the
original netgroup file is processed. 
.TP
Note at least one of the both flags must be specified.
