# securenets	This file defines the access rights to your NIS server
#		for NIS clients. This file contains netmask/network
#		pairs. A clients IP address needs to match with at least
#		one of those.
#
#		One can use the word "host" instead of a netmask of
#		255.255.255.255. Only IP addresses are allowed in this
#		file, not hostnames.
#
# Always allow access for localhost
255.0.0.0	127.0.0.0

# This line gives access to everybody. PLEASE ADJUST!
0.0.0.0		0.0.0.0
