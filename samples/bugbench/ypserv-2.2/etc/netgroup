#
# netgroup	The netgroup file. Entries look like this:
#
#		   netgroup  (host,user,domain)  (host,user,domain) ..
#
#		So for example a netgroup for powerusers could be:
#
#		   powerusers  (,miquels,) (,torvalds,) (,fubar,)
#
#		And an entry in the password file like
#
#		   +@powerusers:::::: 
#		   +:*:::::/etc/NoShell
#
# 		would give access only to the users in "powerusers", while the
# 		other users would be known to the system but have an invalid
#		shell AND an invalid password (with Linux, you can also
#		override the password field).
#

# powerusers (,miquels,) (,torvalds,) (,fubar,)
# ourhosts   (picard,,) (enterprise,,) (laforge,,) (Q,,)
